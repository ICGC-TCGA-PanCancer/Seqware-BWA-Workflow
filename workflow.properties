workflow-description=This is the SeqWare BWA-Mem PanCancer Workflow version 2.2.0.  Please note the reference is hs37d, see ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/README_human_reference_20110707 for more information. Briefly this is the integrated reference sequence from the GRCh37 primary assembly (chromosomal plus unlocalized and unplaced contigs), the rCRS mitochondrial sequence (AC:NC_012920), Human herpesvirus 4 type 1 (AC:NC_007605) and the concatenated decoy sequences (hs37d5cs.fa.gz). This workflow can be created from source, see https://github.com/SeqWare/public-workflows or downloaded in its packaged form from https://s3.amazonaws.com/oicr.workflow.bundles/released-bundles/Workflow_Bundle_BWA_2.2.0_SeqWare_1.0.13.zip.  New features for this workflow compared to 2.1 include: 1) inclusion of QC information in the metadata uploaded to GNOS along with the aligned BAM, 2) cleanup steps added throughout the workflow to reduce the runtime storage footprint, 3) update of the PCAP tools to version 1.0.0 (along with the associated tools including BWA-Mem 0.7.7-r441), 4) improved efficiency with regards to doing more steps in parallel, 5) more statistics also stored in the GNOS metadata including runtime, 6) more consistent encoding of information in the GNOS metadata using JSON values, 7) better handling of @RG (read group ID) headers in the BAM, including use of UUIDs to be globally unique, and 8) improvements and bug fixes to the metadata uploaded to GNOS.
